# Contributing to Torblade

We love minimalism! If you want to contribute:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/Optimization`).
3. Keep it simple. If the logic takes more than 10 minutes to explain, it might be too complex for Torblade.
4. Open a Pull Request.

**Current Focus:**
- Improving `iptables` efficiency.
- Reducing the Docker image footprint.
- Dockerhub release.
